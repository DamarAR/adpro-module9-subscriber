**What is amqp?**

AMQP, or the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol, is a vendor-neutral standard for exchanging messages across distributed applications. It facilitates dependable, non-blocking communication between services, which is essential for building systems that can grow and adapt. AMQP offers capabilities such as message queuing, guaranteed delivery, and flexible routing, and is often paired with brokers like RabbitMQ. By leveraging this protocol, you can decouple components so each service can run independently without having to wait for others.


**What does it mean? guest:guest@localhost:5672 , what is the first guest, and what is the second guest, and what is localhost:5672 is for?**

This string represents the connection URI for an AMQP broker—commonly RabbitMQ—running on your local machine. Here's the breakdown:

- guest – the username

- guest – the password

- localhost – specifies that the broker is hosted locally

- 5672 – the standard port used by RabbitMQ for AMQP connections

In summary, this URI tells the client to connect to a RabbitMQ instance on localhost:5672 using the default credentials guest/guest.
